<h1>Paul's Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 10/10 movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Prison Break</h3>
<p>
Yes, yes, I know it is a TV series, but I still have to mention it. This has to be the greatest screenplay ever written by mankind! I am not kidding! If you haven't watched it yet, you don't know what you are missing. Add it to your movies watchlist and thank me later!<br />
<p>My favourite characters include:<br />
Wentworth Miller<br />
Robert Knepper (the famous T-Bag!)<br />
Dominic Purcell<br />

<h3>2. Home Alone</h3>
<p>Brings back the coolest childhood memories. What was Christmas without Home Alone anyway! I would say probably not that merry!</p>

<P>What can I even say about James Cameron. His movies are a pure touch of gold! Everybody knows that!</P>
